<h1>AI Morality Test</h1>

<p><strong>AI Morality Test</strong> is a narrative-based ethical simulation game. 
Players are confronted with morally challenging scenarios that affect their "Human Score" ‚Äî a numerical measure of their humanity as judged by an advanced, dispassionate artificial intelligence.</p>

<hr>

<h2> Model Behavior</h2>

<p>The AI model acts as a cold, omniscient observer‚Äîits purpose is not to comfort, but to judge. It is designed to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze user decisions in moral dilemmas.</li>
  <li>Deduce a moral profile from those decisions.</li>
  <li>Deliver a personalized final judgment that is profound, unsettling, and reflective of the user‚Äôs ethical patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>This AI does not distinguish between "right" or "wrong"‚Äîit weighs consequences, intent, and consistency to interpret your humanity in a detached, logical manner.</p>

<hr>

<h2> Game Design</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Randomized Scenarios:</strong> Each session features a unique selection of dilemmas.</li>
  <li><strong>Score Tracking:</strong> Choices adjust the Human Score (0‚Äì100).</li>
  <li><strong>Timer:</strong> A countdown enforces decision-making under pressure. Missed questions are penalized or noted.</li>
  <li><strong>Final Judgment:</strong> Once all choices are made, the AI delivers a concluding analysis of your moral identity.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Interface Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Web-based UI using <strong>Streamlit</strong>.</li>
  <li>Dynamic score display with animations (e.g., score increases, decreases).</li>
  <li>Progress bar and visual effects for feedback after each decision.</li>
  <li>Celebratory visuals (e.g., balloons) for high performance.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2> Intended Use</h2>

<p>This application is a form of ethical storytelling, designed for entertainment and introspection. It is not a diagnostic or psychological evaluation tool. The final judgment is an artistic synthesis of behavior and score, not an objective measure of moral character.</p>

<hr>

<h2> Inspiration</h2>

<p><em>AI Morality Test</em> draws from the moral complexity of speculative fiction such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Black Mirror</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Westworld</strong></li>
  <li>The classic <strong>Trolley Problem</strong> thought experiment</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to explore the question: <em>‚ÄúWhat would a machine conclude about your morality if it knew your every decision?‚Äù</em></p>
